# data-collection-challenge

This new assignment consists of two technical products. Where I will submit the following deliverables:
Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
The objective of the first deliverable was to scrape titles and preview texts of Mars news articles from the https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html website.

Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.
This deliverable focuses on web scraping and analysis of meteorological data collected by the Curiosity rover on Mars (https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html). The minimum temperature, atmospheric pressure and other environmental factors are explored to better understand the climatic conditions in different Martian months.

To complete this activity, I have used resources such as Office Hours and the assistance of ChatGPT to debug and optimize the code's functionality. Additionally, I mostly used chatGPT to do the process of exporting the scraped data to a JSON file and
for the use of pd.categorical, which was used to ensure that the months in the bar charts were displayed in a specific order based on average minimum temperatures and also depending on average pressures, rather than simply being ordered numerically.
